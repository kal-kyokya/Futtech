Football is the most popular sport on Earth, uniting people across education, class, and race. It has the power to strengthen communities and inspire dreams. _**Africa must harness this power**_ to uplift itself.<br />
**Through [Futtech](https://www.futtech.kalkyokya.tech)**, I am building a future where African footballers no longer have to leave home to maximize their potentialâ€”because the tools they need will be right here.<br />

Football is one such skill, and technology is a powerful tool that can facilitate its mastery.


### :page_with_curl: Project Description
Futtech is an end-to-end Engineering project focused on build of ```camera-equipped drones```, development of a ```responsively designed web platform``` and integration of an ```assistive Large Language Model```.<br />
This includes backend development, dynamic web content using the MERN Stack, and third-party service integrations (Google Firebase for images, and Mux for Video uploads).

### :wrench: Technologies Used
- JavaScript in JSX.
- React with SASS.
- ExpressJS through by PM2.
- MongoDB via Mongoose.
- NodeJS for the backend.

### :key: Key Contributions
- Developed API endpoints.
- Implemented responsive web interfaces application usage.

### :telescope: How Futtech Works
A seamless experience from recording training sessions to getting scouted:
- **Training Sessions Recording**: Video content is uploaded to Futtech; Users book drone-recording sessions on Futtech's website or simply avail phone-recorded ones.
- **Video Streaming**: Uploaded content is safely stored and made available for on-demand streaming. 
- **AI-Driven Analytics**: If requested, Futtechâ€™s system processes the video data and identifies key metrics.
- **Performance Reports**: Users receives detailed insights on their game.
- **Growth & Visibility**: The data helps Users better define their identity, refine their skills and potentially attract scouts.
